# **A Textual Universe**
## **A space game about exploring a randomly generated universe that lives within your console window.**

A Textual Universe's defining feature is that it is entirely ASCII art and text based. Yet the underlying mechanisms of the game are much more complicated than just text. You will be the pioneer of your own universe exploring a seemimly infinite universe from finding new galaxies to building colonies on asteroids you can do it all in A Textual Universe without needing an expensive computer to play it!

Inspired by a previous attempt at making a Discord Economy bot with a similar concept but more economy focused, this game is meant to take the uniqueness of the ASCII based graphics and have a really interesting and enjoyable game anyone can play, anywhere.
